This project about to establish a bus seat reservation system. Basically, the bus is organised with 30 seats and the seat arranged with 3 in a row which means
 there is 3 seat in a row ; single seat next to double seat. The user can choose and reserve any seat as long as it not belong to anyone. However,
 the single seat is more expensive compared to double seat. 
 So at first, the system will display the arrangement of seat in the bus and can choose the seat. After choosing the seat, the user next to fill in the quantity for
 single seat or double seat that her/his chosen. The system will calculate the cost/price of that reservation.
